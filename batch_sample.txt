REM --- Set Variables (Basic Types) ---

set A2=World
set A3="From Batch"
set EMPTY=
set WHITESPACE=     
set QUOTED="Quoted String"
set PATH_VAR=C:\Program Files\Test

REM --- Set Variables with Embedded Quotes ---
set WITH_QUOTES="This is ""a tricky"" string"

REM --- Set Variables with Trailing Spaces ---
set TRAIL=EndsHere    
set LEAD=     StartsHere
set BOTH=   Surround   

REM --- Set Variables with Special Characters ---
set SPECIAL1=!@#$%^&*()

REM --- Nested Variable Definitions ---
set NESTED_SIMPLE=%A1% %A2%
set NESTED_DEEP=%NESTED_SIMPLE% %QUOTED%
set DOUBLE_NESTED=%NESTED_DEEP% :: End

REM --- Self-referencing Variable (should remain unchanged) ---
set SELF=%SELF%

REM --- Mixed Content (Should Test Parser Logic) ---
REM Not a SET: set_this=should_not_be_captured
REM Partial: setA4=NoSpace

REM --- Commands with Variable Usage ---
echo Basic: %A1% %A2%
echo Quoted: %A3%
echo Empty: -%EMPTY%-
echo Whitespaced: -%WHITESPACE%-
echo FilePath: %PATH_VAR%
echo Quotes Inside: %WITH_QUOTES%
echo Trail/Lead/Both: "%LEAD%" "%TRAIL%" "%BOTH%"
echo Special Chars: %SPECIAL1% and %SPECIAL2%
echo Escaped Echo: %ESCAPE_TEST%
echo Nested Simple: %NESTED_SIMPLE%
echo Nested Deep: %NESTED_DEEP%
echo Double Nested: %DOUBLE_NESTED%
echo Self Ref: %SELF%

REM --- Undefined Variables ---
echo Undefined1: %UNDEF1%
echo Mid-sentence undefined: start-%UNDEF2%-end
echo Command with undefined: copy %UNDEF3% destination

REM --- Irregular SET Formatting ---
SeT    MIXEDCASE=MixedValue
SET no_space=NoSpaceDetected
set    spaced_out      =     yes
Set quoted="quoted manually"

echo MixedCase: %MIXEDCASE%

REM --- REM vs Real Command Confusion ---
REM echo This should be ignored
ReM echo Still ignored
REMecho Not a comment — real command?

REM --- Commented SETs (should be skipped) ---
REM set COMMENTED=not_real
REMset FAKE=wrong

REM --- Delayed Expansion Simulation ---
REM These won't work in real batch unless delayed expansion is on
REM But should remain untouched by static deobfuscator
set DELAYED=Before
REM !DELAYED! won’t be resolved here, just for tool robustness
echo Delayed style: !DELAYED!

REM --- Line with multiple variable references ---
echo MultiVar: %A1%-%A2%-%QUOTED%-%TRAIL%

REM --- Line with mixed valid and invalid vars ---
echo Mix: %A1%-%NOT_SET%-%MIXEDCASE%

REM --- Obfuscation Simulation ---
set xx1=%A1%
set xx2=%xx1% %A2%
set xx3=%xx2% %QUOTED%
echo Obf Chain: %xx3%
